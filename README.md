## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Bootstrap 5 (optional library)**

---

## 🚀 Solution Approach

- **Structure:**  
  We carefully analyzed the reference design and built a clean, semantic HTML structure.

- **Styling:**  
  We used custom CSS for styling to match the reference portfolio layout, ensuring clean, organized, and well-commented code.

- **Responsiveness:**  
  The portfolio is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using Bootstrap grid system and media queries.

- **Collaboration:**  
  We divided the work into sections (Landing Page, Services, Footer, etc.), using Git and GitHub to collaborate effectively.

- **Enhancements:**  
  We added minor aesthetic improvements (hover effects, smoother transitions) without altering the core layout to maintain authenticity.
